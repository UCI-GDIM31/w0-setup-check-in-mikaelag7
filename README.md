# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.
My name is Mikaela Gonzales and my pronouns are she/her. I prefer action games but I'm down to play anthing with a good story. Right now I'm trying to play Red Dead Redemption 2 because a friend recommended it to me. But it's taking me a while to get through it. I'm taking the class because it's a required class for my major. I'm also taking it because I enjoy coding, I have experience in Python and Java. 
2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ ] Game Design & Interactive Media

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
I'm hoping to gain experience coding games using Unity.

4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
For this class I would say I'm most nervous about navigating the different resources we have to use. There was a lot of different things we had to download so I know there is going to be a learning curve. 
## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.
